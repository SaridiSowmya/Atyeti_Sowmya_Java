Producer-Consumer using LinkedBlockingQueue
Problem Statement: ImageProcessingPipeline
Simulate an image processing pipeline where:

Multiple camera feeds (producers) keep generating image frames.

A pool of worker threads (consumers) processes each frame.

Use LinkedBlockingQueue to allow buffering between producers and consumers.

Key Concepts:
Multiple producer and consumer threads.

LinkedBlockingQueue<byte[]> for simulated image data.

Graceful shutdown signal (e.g., poison pill).

Challenges:
Blocking behavior when the queue is full.

Efficient use of thread pool.

Monitor processing throughput.
