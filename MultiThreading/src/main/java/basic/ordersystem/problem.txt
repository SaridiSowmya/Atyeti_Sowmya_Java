Order Processing System (Producer-Consumer)
Problem Statement:
Simulate an order system where one thread generates orders (producer), and multiple threads process them (consumers).
What You Learn:
Thread-safe queue usage
BlockingQueue
Basic thread creation and coordination
How to Do:
Create an Order class (POJO).
Use BlockingQueue<Order> to share data between threads.
Producer thread → queue.put(order)
Consumer thread → queue.take()
Start N consumer threads from ExecutorService.
